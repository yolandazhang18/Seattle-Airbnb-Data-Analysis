# DSND Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I will use the Seattle Airbnb dataset to practice data loading, data cleaning, data imputation, data visualization, feature selection and feature engineering, data modeling, and sentiment analysis using machine learning.

Throughout this work, I will be focusing on answering the following questions:

1. What's the best time to visit Seattle with for affordable stays/profitable rentings?

2. What are the main drivers for a high listing prices (time, location, amenities)?

3. What the visitors care most about their stays?

## Data Source

The dataset (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)) we will be using includes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, as part of the Airbnb Inside initiative. 

The dataset has three data files:<br>
`calendar`: Listing id and the price and availability for that day<br>
`listings`: Full descriptions and average review score<br>
`reviews`: Unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
