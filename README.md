# DSND Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis

## Project Overview

In this project, I will use the Seattle Airbnb dataset to practice data loading, data cleaning, data imputation, data visualization, feature selection and feature engineering, data modeling, and sentiment analysis using machine learning.

Throughout this project, I will be focusing on the following questions:

1. What are the busiest (and most profitable) times of the year for Seattle hosts?

2. What are the main drivers for higher listing prices?

3. What do visitors care most about their stays?

## Data Source

The dataset (available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle)) we will be using includes the listing activities of homestays in Seattle, as part of the Airbnb Inside initiative. 

The dataset has three data files:<br>
`calendar`: Listing id and the price and availability for that day<br>
`listings`: Full descriptions and average review score<br>
`reviews`: Unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

## Files

#### Notebook 1: Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis-Part1&2 

#### Notebook 2: Seattle Airbnb Data Analysis-Part3 

#### Data files: `calendar.csv`, `listings.csv`, `reviews.csv`
